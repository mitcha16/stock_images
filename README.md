An app where users can search for free stock images and save them to their account.

I hope to add functionality so that users can upload their own photos instead of just searching for them off of unsplash and follow other users. This is mostly just for practice. Once I complete this, I intend to go back and try out some serve side rendering with react along with ajax for the search.

**I definitely need to add test coverage as well but I built this in a hurry to play around with some frontend stuff.
